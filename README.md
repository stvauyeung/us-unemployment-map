## US Unemployment Trends Map

This repository houses a  data visualization application made using [Shiny](http://www.shinyapps.io/), and US unemployment data from the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](http://www.bls.gov/cps/tables.htm).  The BLS data was combined and transformed into the `mapData.csv` dataset housed in the `data` folder of the Shiny app.

This application was created as part of the ["Developing Data Products"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products) course on Coursera.  Anyone can download this repository and run the application locally using R or RStudio, and the `shiny` package.
